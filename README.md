# About myself
## I'm a BSc Computer Science and AI student at Bath, really into artificial intelligence and systems design. Iâ€™m known for being a problem-solver and working well in teams. Iâ€™m all about learning and growing, and Iâ€™m on the lookout for challenging opportunities where I can put my tech and leadership skills to use.
